# Changelog

## 0.1.0 (2026-10-28)

First release of the `rayner` package, a fork of Ivar Vong's Lantern.

- Author technical explainers as TypeScript scenes with reader settings, named steps and captions.
- Build portable HTML pages with transcripts, picture descriptions, linkable steps, embedding support and response-header recipes. The browser runtime has no dependencies.
- Capture Agentic Mermaid diagrams at build time and animate their parts by id. Check every declared case, including imported-label collisions and visible route crossings, before publishing.
- Use native shapes, camera movement, charts, code diffs and matching transforms alongside diagrams. Text starts centred on its advance box; scene admission avoids duplicate subtree painting.
- Request additional scripts, replacement faces, real bold and italic, and typeset maths through committed lettering snapshots. See [supported requests](docs/LETTERING.md).
- Review every catalog step at phone and desktop widths, including actual painted subjects and close-up tours. The WCAG Focus Visible step opens on the criterion its caption explains.
- Use the `rayner` CLI to initialise, preview, capture, check, build and inspect scenes. PNG contact sheets are included.
- Run `rayner review` on an outside author's scene, with optional independent caption claims. Watched previews recapture requested lettering after edits.
- Export a generated catalog and deployment manifest with complete build inputs; stage and validate the collection before replacing its files and response-header rules.

Requires Node 24 or later. Authoring targets Ubuntu and macOS; Windows is not yet supported. Diagram capture needs Chromium. Additional lettering capture needs Python and the documented source fonts; committed snapshots replay without them.

The [tutorial](docs/TUTORIAL.md) covers the first scene. [Publishing](docs/PUBLISHING.md) covers hosting and embedding. [Upstream](docs/UPSTREAM.md) records engine fixes and attribution.
